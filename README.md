# Prediction-Santander-Bank-Customer-Satisfaction

This is to make predicitons about customer satisfaction, basically speaking the predicitons are probabilities and use some threshold to 
make predictions.

The feature selection methods used in feature engineering Lasso, Elastic Net, LDA, PCA, Best subset, randomforest importance etc.. I only focus on using XGBoost as the method of prediction because it works really fast don't require too much computation time. 

Some new features are also created to make predictions. Deep learning method is also tried using python since I found python work faster than R for XGBoost method. 

XGBoost is a new boosting method and you can access: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf
